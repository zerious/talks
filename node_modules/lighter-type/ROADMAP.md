# lighter-type Roadmap

***This is a living document. It describes priorities as they are perceived
today, and it can evolve over time.***

## Type.inherits
As of version 1, lighter-type does not do exactly what util.inherits does, so it's not a suitable swap-in replacement.

## Visualization
It would be nice to optionally see an inheritance diagram showing which Type objects extend which others.

## Validation
There should be an option to check the types of inputs, at least in a development environment where most debugging is done, and where performance is not critical.

## Got ideas?
If you have ideas for features that should be in this roadmap, please submit
a pull request.
