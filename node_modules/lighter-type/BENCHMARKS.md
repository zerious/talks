# lighter-type Benchmarks

Micro benchmarks shouldn't be the sole reason to choose a library, however,
speed is a feature, so performance should not be overlooked. The following
benchmarks can be run by cloning this repository, installing dependencies,
and using the `bench` script, built on [Exam](http://lighter.io/exam).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lighterio/lighter-type.git
cd lighter-type
npm run prebench
npm run bench -T 60000 # Roughly 60 seconds per benchmark.
```

Results vary, and this is merely the output from a single set of runs. This
set of results shows that while defining Type objects is 37% slower than
with Fiber, it is faster to testingiate a Type instance than in other
inheritance libraries. Since objects might be testingiated many times in a
service before it needs to restart, the `lighter-type` library has the
overall advantage.
